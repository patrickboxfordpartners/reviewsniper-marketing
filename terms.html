            <h3>12.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>These Terms, together with any SOWs and license agreements, constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral.</p>

            <h3>12.2 Amendments</h3>
            <p>We may modify these Terms by providing 30 days' notice via email or by posting updated Terms on our website. Continued use of services after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. Material changes to SOWs require written agreement from both parties.</p>
